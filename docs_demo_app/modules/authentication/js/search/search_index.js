simple way. They're written in Angular (v6) including the material design.\nKnora itself is a software framework for storing, sharing, and working with primary sources and data in the humanities.\nIt is developed by the Digital Humanities Lab at the University of Basel, and is supported by the Swiss Academy of Humanities and Social Sciences.\nKnora and the Knora ui elements is free software, released under the GNU Affero General Public License.\nAlready published modules\n@knora/core\n \nThe core module contains every service to use Knora's RESTful webapi.\n@knora/authentication\n\nThe authentication module contains the login form (for standalone usage) or a complete login- / logout-button environment incl. the login form.\n@knora/search\n\nSearch module allows to make simple searches or extended searches in Knora. In extended search, resource class and its properties related to one specific ontology are selected to create your query.\n@knora/viewer\n\nThe viewer module contains object components to show the resource class representations from Knora, the gui-elements for the property values and different kind of view frameworks.\n@knora/action\n\nThe action module contains special buttons (e.g. to sort a list), pipes and directives.\nDevelopers note\nGood news: Angular 6 has a built-in library support. Previous we built the library with the following setup:\nWe used ng-packagr by following the ng-packaged-example and this tutorial: https://medium.com/@nikolasleblanc/building-an-angular-4-component-library-with-the-angular-cli-and-ng-packagr-53b2ade0701e\nNow we can create a library module quite easy. Please use the following command schema:\n$ ng generate library @knora/[module-name] --prefix=kui\nIf you want to add more components, services and so on to this library, you can do it with:\n$ ng generate component [path/in/your/module/][name-of-component] --project @knora/[module-name]\nIt puts the component or the service into lib/ directly. Otherwise you can define a path inside of lib/.\nInstall the demo app\n$ cd knora-ui\n\n$ yarn install --prod=false\n\n$ rm -rf dist/@knora\n$ yarn build-libThe demo app runs on http://localhost:4200 and we use it on this repository's Github page\nDeveloping modules\nTo create new e.g. component inside existing module use the following command:\n$ ng g c [component-name] --project @knora/[module-name] --styleext scss\n\nKnora module structure\n@knora/core\n\n\nservices (for API requests)\nconstants & utils (to work with Knora)\n\n@knora/action\n\n\nbuttons & buttons\nprogress-indicator\nprogress-stepper\nmessage\ndirectives & pipes\ndialog\n\n@knora/authentication\n\n\nlogin\nlogout\n\n@knora/search\n\n\nsearch results\nsearch panel incl. search action (like adding a collection)\n\n@knora/viewer\n\n\nobject viewer (incl. video, audio, image)\nproperties (as form elements)\nresource_class_form\n\n {\n    const observables = [];\n\n    for (let i = 0; i (this.heroesUrl)\n        .pipe(\n          catchError(this.handleError('getAllHeroes', []))\n      )\n      );\n    }\n\n    return forkJoin(observables);\n\n  }\n  ``` \n\n* Several http requests are created and pushed on an array, then they are passed to forkJoin and returned. With forkJoin, we get one Observable that we can subscribe to (executed once all Observables have been completed). Then we get the results of all Observables from within the subscription to the Observable returned by forkJoin.\n\n```TypeScript\n it('should get all heroes', () => {\n\n      let res = heroService.getAllHeroes();   \n\n      res.subscribe(\n        (obs) => { \n\n          console.log(\"test\")\n\n          expect(obs[0]).toEqual(expectedHeroes, 'should return expected heroes');\n          expect(obs[1]).toEqual(expectedHeroes, 'should return expected heroes');\n          expect(obs[2]).toEqual(expectedHeroes, 'should return expected heroes');\n        }, fail\n      );\n\n      // HeroService should have made three requests to GET heroes from expected URL\n      const req = httpTestingController.match(\n        (request) => {\n          return request.url === heroService.heroesUrl && request.method === 'GET'\n        }\n      );\n\n      // Respond with the mock heroes\n      expect(req.length).toEqual(3);\n\n      req[0].flush(expectedHeroes)\n      req[1].flush(expectedHeroes)\n      req[2].flush(expectedHeroes)\n\n    });\n```\n\n* The clue is that for each http request made, a response has to be \"flushed\". Otherwise the subscription to the Observable returned by forkJoin is never executed:\nIf an inner observable does not complete forkJoin will never emit a value!\nhttps://www.learnrxjs.io/operators/combination/forkjoin.html\n\n> This is why the subscription never worked, because we did not flush all necessary responses. -->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules - modules","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n    Modules\n\n\n    \n            \n                \n                    \n                        KuiAuthenticationModule\n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            Browse\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"overview.html":{"url":"overview.html","title":"overview - overview","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n    Overview\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        1 Module\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    1 Component\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    2 Injectables\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    1 Guard\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"miscellaneous/variables.html":{"url":"miscellaneous/variables.html","title":"miscellaneous-variables - variables","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Miscellaneous\n  Variables\n\n\n\n    Index\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            moment   (projects/.../session.service.ts)\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    projects/knora/authentication/src/lib/session/session.service.ts\n    \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                            moment\n                            \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        moment:     \n\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Default value : momentImported\n                        \n                    \n\n\n            \n        \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
