[![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@knora/action.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@knora/action)

This module is part of [Knora-ui](https://github.com/dhlab-basel/Knora-ui) modules, developed by the team at the [Data and Service Center for Humanities DaSCH](http://dasch.swiss).

The action module contains special pipes to sort lists or to get the index key in arrays, but also directives for images, sort buttons and s.o.

## Prerequisites

For help getting started with a new Angular app, check out the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/).

### NPM

`npm install --save @knora/action`

-   @angular/core@7.2.7

import { KuiActionModule } from '@knora/action';

@NgModule({
    declarations: [
        AppComponent
    ],

        KuiActionModule
    ],
    providers: [ ],
    bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {
}
```

## Components, Directives and Pipes

This module contains various components like a progress indicator, sort button and sort-by pipe, but also helper for images (in the admin interface) and existing names.

<!--
### Progress indicator

You can use the progress indicator in two ways:

1. classic loader
2. submit-form-data loader

[Example and demo](https://dhlab-basel.github.io/Knora-ui/modules/action/progress-indicator)


### Sort button

The sort button helps to sort a list by a selected topic. The following setup is needed:

- sortProps is an array of {name, label} object and is needed for the selection.
- the sort button returns a sortKey which is needed in the list and the pipe called kuiSortBy


[Example and demo](https://dhlab-basel.github.io/Knora-ui/modules/action/sort-button)

## Directives

### Admin image
A attribute directive for images (`<img />`) to get a user avatar, which uses the service from gravatar.com and to set a project logo.

[Example and demo](https://dhlab-basel.github.io/Knora-ui/modules/action/admin-image)


### Existing Name
This directive checks a form field to see if the value is unique. For example username or project short-name should be unique. Therefore we use the ExistingNameDirective.

[Example and demo](https://dhlab-basel.github.io/Knora-ui/modules/action/existing-name)

[Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/knora-existing-name?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts)


---


## Pipes

### Key
In case of an object, where you don't know the labels or in case of an array with no numeric index, you can use the Key pipe.

[Example and demo](https://dhlab-basel.github.io/Knora-ui/modules/action/key)


### Sort by
The sortBy pipe is used to sort by a selected key.

[Example and demo in sort button component](https://dhlab-basel.github.io/Knora-ui/modules/action/sort-button)
