# Dokumentado
This is a default template made for Github repository pages incl. landing page, release notes and the documentation.

It's designed with [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/index.html) and built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) version 3.3.1, but should support newer versions as well.

## Dependencies

Install the dependencies with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

~~~bash
$ bundle install
~~~

Run `jekyll` commands through Bundler to ensure you're using the right versions:

~~~bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
~~~

To see the generated site, just visit `http://localhost:4000`.
