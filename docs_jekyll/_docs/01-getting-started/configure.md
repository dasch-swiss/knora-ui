You have to configure your page settings in the `_config.yml` file. It should be self-explained.

### Structure
The template has several folders and files, which are important. For the landing page you have to use the `index.html` file.

The documentation files should be stored in `_docs` or in `_manual`. Each of the folder has a `_default.md` file template.

Posts of the category "news" are stored in `_posts`. The files inside of this folder should start with the date of format 'yyyy-mm-dd' and followed by the title.
