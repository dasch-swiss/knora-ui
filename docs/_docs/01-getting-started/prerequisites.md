You can use this template by fork it from [Github](https://github.com/lakto/dokumentado) or to pull it from there. It's built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) version 3.3.1, but should support newer versions as well.

You have to be in the root directory of Dokumentado to install the dependencies as follow:

~~~bash
$ bundle install
~~~

Run `jekyll` commands through Bundler to ensure you're using the right versions:

~~~bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
~~~

To see the generated site, just visit `http://localhost:4000`.
