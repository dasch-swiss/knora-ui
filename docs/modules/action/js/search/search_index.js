Basel.\nInstall\nYou can use either the npm or yarn command-line tool to install packages. Use whichever is appropriate for your project.\nNPM\nnpm install --save @knora/action ts-md5@^1.2.4 jdnconvertiblecalendar@0.0.2 jdnconvertiblecalendardateadapter@0.0.7\nYarn\nyarn add @knora/action ts-md5@^1.2.4 jdnconvertiblecalendar@0.0.2 jdnconvertiblecalendardateadapter@0.0.7\n\nComponents\nThis module contains various components:\nProgress indicator\nYou can use the progress indicator in two ways:\n1. classic loader\nExample and demo\n\n2. submit-form-data loader\nExample and demo\nThis kind of progress indicator needs the Angular Material Icons. So you have to import them into your app first by using the style file and adding the following line:\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons');\nThen you can use the progress indicator in your template as follow:\n\nStatus is a number:\n\n-1 => not ready\n0 => is loading\n1 => done\n\nand in case of an error: the number is 400\nSort button\nExample and Demo\nThe sort button helps to sort a list by a selected topic. The following setup is needed:\n\nsortProps is an array of {name, label} object and is needed for the selection.\nthe sort button returns a sortKey which is needed in the list and the pipe called sortBy\n\nhtml template\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            {{item.prename}}\n        \n        \n            {{item.lastname}}\n        \n        by \n        \n            {{item.creator}}\n        \n    \nOptions\nIt's possible to set the position of the sort button to right side.\n\n\n\nDirectives\nAdmin image\nA attribute directive for images () to get a user avatar, which uses the service from gravatar.com and to set a project logo.\n1. html template for project logo\n\n2. html template for user avatar\n\nFeature in both types\n\nIf no [image] is defined, a default image will be displayed.\nIf the defined image is not found, a default error-image will be displayed.\n\nExisting Name\nThis directive checks a form field to see if the value is unique. For example username or project short-name should be unique. Therefore we use the ExistingNameDirective.\nSee the Stackblitz example how it works.\n\nPipes\nKey\nIn case of an object, where you don't know the labels or in case of an array with no numeric index, you can use the Key pipe. \nFor this array\narray = [];\n\n// ... \n\nthis.array['index-1'] = 'Value in index 1';\nthis.array['index-2'] = 'Value in index 2';\nthis.array['index-3'] = 'Value in index 3';\n\n]we can use it in the template as follow:\n\n    \n        {{item.key}}: {{item.value}}\n    \nWhich shows this list\n\nindex-1: Value in index 1\nindex-2: Value in index 2\nindex-3: Value in index 3\n\nSee the Stackblitz example how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules - modules","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n    Modules\n\n\n    \n            \n                \n                    \n                        KuiActionModule\n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            Browse\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"overview.html":{"url":"overview.html","title":"overview - overview","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n    Overview\n\n\n    \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            1 module\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        3 components\n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        4 directives\n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        3 pipes\n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        1 class\n                    \n                \n            \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
